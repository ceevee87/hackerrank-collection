# hackerrank-collection
Collection of solutions for Hacker Rank problems. Written in C#.

# My profile
I love solving problems and I love writing code! My hackerrank id is 'ceevee87' and as of Fall 2019 I earned my 6-star 
Gold Badge in Algorithms on Hackerrank.

# Languages
This repository will contain solutions to some but not all of my hackerrank problems. I currently prefer C#.

# Validation
Almost all of my C# solutions come with accompanying NUnit3 tests. Some of the tests I write myself. Others I download from Hackerrank. 

# Notes
HackerRank requires that all solutions be submitted as single files. This will make some of my solutions not as well organized as
I would prefer. For example, you will see some solutions with extra classes included all in one file, like a Heap. I normally put
this code in a separate file but for Hackerrank purposes I will lump all of it in one .cs file.

I have .pdf files for the problem descriptions for some but not all of the problems I solve in this repository.

# IDE
I use Visual Studio 2019 and 2015

The operating system is Windows 10.
